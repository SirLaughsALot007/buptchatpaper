\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose an inaudible adversarial perturbation (IAP) attack against ASR systems named \alias, which can extend to scenarios where users are present and may use ASR services. In such scenarios, prior studies will fail due to \textit{user auditory} and \textit{user disruption}. 
We make the first attempt to model the ultrasonic transformation process, based on which, \alias can alter arbitrary user commands to the adversary-desired intent in real time without any knowledge of users' speech. Our comprehensive experiments in the digital and physical worlds across various configurations demonstrate \alias's effectiveness and robustness. Overall, \alias features merits including complete inaudibility, universality, and long-range attack ability.
