\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

The preliminary design of the Dragonfly navigation filter has been developed and demonstrated to robustly navigate the vehicle over multiple kilometer flights in a high fidelity Titan simulation. While the Dragonfly mission is unique, several contributions are applicable to the broader inertial navigation, VIO, and TRN fields including a new architecture for redundant IMUs, improving global heading and position knowledge by revisiting images after re-initializing the filter on the surface, and a robust approximation to the SLAM formulation. Several updates and optimizations are underway to improve the nav filter including porting the EKF to the UDU implementation~\cite{carpenter2018}, modeling correlated pressure sensor measurements, reducing the nav filter update rate to 1 Hz, and a higher fidelity terrain model. An alternate breadcrumb model is also being explored to better preserve cross covariance information with all the filter states. Filter updates to support image processing updates are also expected in the next phase, such as using processing multiple image patches or ingesting the displacement measurement directly in pixels.
