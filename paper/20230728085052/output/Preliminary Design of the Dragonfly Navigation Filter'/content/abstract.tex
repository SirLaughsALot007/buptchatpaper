 Dragonfly is scheduled to begin exploring Titan by 2034 using a series of multi-kilometer surface flights. This paper outlines the preliminary design of the navigation filter for the Dragonfly Mobility subsystem. The software architecture and filter formulation for lidar, visual odometry, pressure sensors, and redundant IMUs are described in detail. Special discussion is given to developments to achieve multi-kilometer surface flights, including optimizing sequential image baselines, modeling correlating image processing errors, and an efficient approximation to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem.
