%%Early developments in 2D:

%Pose graph optimization is a fundamental SLAM alternative to incremental filtering ... and batch optimization over both poses and landmarks ... . Also known as graph SLAM, it limits the estimation to the sensor frame poses, thereby achieving efficient large-scale registration capabilities. Furthermore, pose graph optimization is more easily amenable to scenarios in which local contraints do not adhere to simple noise models (e.g. Gaussian distributions) and motion models may not be given.

%The first approaches presented in the literature are restricted to the planar case and perform least-squares optimization using LU-decomposition~\cite{lu97}. Gutmann and Konolidge~\cite{gutmann99} lateron apply the technique as a back-end module to reconcile front-end estimations coming from both incremental registration and loop closure detections. Later contributions mainly focus on the efficiency of the pose graph optimization by employing relaxations~\cite{howard01,duckett02,frese05} and local updating~\cite{howard01,duckett02,frese05,olson06}. The seminal contribution of Olson et al.~cite{olson06} lead to a significant improvement of optimization robustness and efficiency using tree-based updates~\cite{frese06} and stochastic gradient descent.

%%Interim and 3D

%Initial extensions to full 6 DoF pose optimization focus on handling the non-commutative nature of Euler angle paramtetrizations. Howard et al.~\cite{howard04} bypass the problem by assuming that roll and pitch are accurately measured, while Nu\"chter et al.~\cite{nuechter05} assume that these angles are affected by only small errors. Triebel et al.~\cite{triebel06} in turn parametrize the environment as an ensemble of multiple horizontal surfaces located at different heights. The most notable seminal contributions in 6 DoF pose graph optimization have been made by Grisetti et al.~\cite{grisetti07a,grisetti07b,grisetti09}, who extend the efficient tree-based stochastic optimization method of Olson et al.~\cite{olson06} and further push computational efficiency. Grisetti et al.~\cite{grisetti10} lateron present yet another seminal extension of the technique, which enables hierarchical pose graph optimization. Around the same time, Koichi et al.~\cite{koichi10} present the addition of unary factors to include GPS constraints into the optimization. S\"underhauf and Protzel~\cite{suenderhauf12} and Wang and Olson~\cite{olson10} contribute towards the robustness of pose graph optimization. A comprehensive tutorial on pose graph optimization is presented by Grisetti et al.~\cite{grisetti10}, and a popular software framework containing many of the advancements listed here is given by \textit{g2o}~\cite{kuemmerle11}.

%%Similarity to other fields

%It is worth noting that both batch least-squares optimization methods~\cite{triggs00} as well tree-based estimation techniques~\cite{dellaert05,kaess08} have also been introduced for joint optimization over poses and structure. Furthermore, the topics of graph-based optimization have also been investigated in the computer vision community (e.g. robust rotation averaging~\cite{hartley12,govindu13,eriksson}, robust translation averaging~\cite{wilson14}, and pose synchronization~\cite{crandall11,cui15}.

%%Highly relevant for this paper:

%The most highly related work to ours is given by Strasdat et al.~\cite{strasdat10}, who explicitly consider the scale invariant nature of single camera geometry. However, in their work they assume nonetheless that the relative scale between connected nodes in the graph is a measured, gaussian-distributed variable. The scale invariant nature is also addressed by Pinies et al.~\cite{pinies08}, who even discuss the partitioning of the graph into several conditionally independent sub-graphs. However, rather than explicitly handling the unknown scale of each sub-graph, they assume that the latter are approximately scaled via the additional of absolute velocity readings during the initialization phase of monocular SLAM. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to directly reconcile sub-graphs of arbitrary relative scale through a joint, hybrid, scale jump-aware graph optimization framework.
